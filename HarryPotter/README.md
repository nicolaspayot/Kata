# HarryPotter
This problem is all about pricing rules for a set of 5 books, Harry Potter saga. The idea is to find the total price of a cart
in a bookstore, given 5 different books and the following rules:
- <b>1 copy</b> of any book costs <b>8 EUR</b>
- <b>2 different books</b> gives a <b>5%</b> discount on those 2 books
- <b>3 different books</b> = <b>10%</b> discount
- <b>4 different books</b> = <b>20%</b> discount
- <b>All 5 books</b> = <b>25%</b> discount

Goal is to get a taste of Cucumber.js with BDD. I'll try to show the different steps with the commits.<br>
Execute `npm install` to get Cucumber.js and `npm test` to run the tests.
